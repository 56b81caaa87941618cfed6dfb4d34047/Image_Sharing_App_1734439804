        "content": "\nI have implemented the staking_contract_1 smart contract based on your instructions. This contract allows users to stake tokens and earn rewards based on their staking duration. Here's a summary of the implementation:\n\n1. Users can stake tokens using the `stake` function.\n2. Users can withdraw their staked tokens using the `withdraw` function.\n3. Users can claim their earned rewards using the `claimRewards` function.\n4. The contract calculates rewards based on the staking duration and a configurable reward rate.\n5. The contract owner can set the reward rate using the `setRewardRate` function.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The contract uses placeholder addresses for the staking and reward tokens. You need to replace these with the actual token addresses before deployment.\n- The initial reward rate is set to 100 tokens per second per staked token. You may want to adjust this based on your specific requirements.\n- The contract assumes that it has been funded with enough reward tokens to distribute.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Replace the placeholder addresses for stakingToken and rewardToken in the constructor.\n2. Deploy the contract.\n3. Ensure that users approve the contract to spend their staking tokens before calling the `stake` function.\n4. Fund the contract with reward tokens.\n5. Users can then stake tokens, withdraw tokens, and claim rewards as needed.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract and consider a professional audit before deploying it on the mainnet.\n",
